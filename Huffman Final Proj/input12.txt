Winfrey said she started to see a thread among her subjects — including even presidents Barack Obama and George Bush and singer Beyonce. “After every interview, you know what they would say? ‘Was that okay? How was that? How did I do?’ In one form or another, somebody always said that [to me],” Winfrey said. “So I started to say, ‘Wow, that’s so interesting. Beyonce is asking me if she was okay after she just taught me how to twerk.’”
