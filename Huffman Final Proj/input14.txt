Winfrey soon realized that every issue or problem on which she did a show was at its root due to someone not being noticed. “I can tell you, in your daily encounters, in your kitchen, in your conference rooms, in your work, in all of your relationships...that is what every person you encounter is looking to know. Did you see me? Do you hear me? And every argument is about that.” Since realizing that, Winfrey said she has made a conscious effort to validate the people she interacts with on a daily basis. To do so, she said she has learned to be more present. “I practice this thing called mindfulness every day, which means really just staying present in the moment,” Winfrey said. Winfrey, 66, said in 2018 Super Soul podcast that learning how to meditate was ”[o]ne of the most life-enhancing things I ever did.”
